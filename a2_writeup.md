# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
    The length of the single program.
    It got so long it became hard to read. When debugging, it took forever to read though my code and see just WHERE my error was. Not even fix it. I need to add more comments and I need to code cleaner. I had to much excess. And I need to add more comments. Like, more comments. #comments


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
    You could search the movies in your database for any movies matching the names from the result of the program.
